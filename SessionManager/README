Ulteo Open Virtual Desktop - Session Manager
============================================

Installation
------------

If you install from svn you'll need to have these packages installed:
 - autogen
 - autconf
 - intltool
 - make
 - gcc
 - libc6-dev (or glibc-devel)
 - libglib2.0-dev (or glib2-devel)

To prepare the sources run:
$ ./autogen.sh

The first step is to run:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install # you might need to be root

Apache configuration
--------------------

A default configuration file for apache2 is installed in
$(sysconfdir)/ulteo/sessionmanager/apache2.conf.
This file needs to be linked in the apache2 conf.d/ directory to enable an
alias pointing to /sessionmanager.

The apache group needs to access the log and spool directories. If these
directories are are installed in /var and the apache group is apache (this is
the default redhat group), you'll need to run these commands:

$ chown root:apache /var/spool/ulteo/sessionmanager /var/log/ulteo/sessionmanager
$ chmod 755 /var/spool/ulteo /var/log/ulteo
$ chmod 2770 /var/spool/ulteo/sessionmanager /var/log/ulteo/sessionmanager
