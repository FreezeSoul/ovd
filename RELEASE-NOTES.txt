=== Ulteo Open Virtual Desktop 1.0 beta1 ===

  * AD support
    * Is using LDAP (only ou=Users group)
    * CIFS mounts are using login/password

  * Java applet
    * Java version: needs Java Runtime Environment 1.5.x and above

  * Invitation system
    * Is using a smtp server on the session manager server

  * Webservices between Sessionmanager and ApplicationServer:
    * Authentication checking is using IP address and reverse DNS

  * When installed on a Red Hat system, the printing feature does not work yet
    due to an unknown issue with cups2all. Works fine on Ubuntu 8.04 servers.

  * Remote APT
    * /var/apt/sources.list file is static, ie it can't be managed from the
      administrator console yet.

  * LDAP support: works fine, but still a bit rough to enable! In order to
    enable, replace the false by true on function "enable" in
    /.../sessionmanager/admin/modules/UserDB/ldap.php

  * NFS support works fine but still a bit rough to configure

  * Homedir module_fs: variable names are hardcoded in the server code
